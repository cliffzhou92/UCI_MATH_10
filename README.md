# UCI-MATH 10: Introduction to Programming for Data Science
Math 10 serves as the introductory course in programming and machine learning algorithms, mainly targeted for the students with mathematical background and have interests in the Data Science specialization. In addition to the introduction of popular python data science packages (Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn and Scikit-learn), this course also emphasizes the understandings of rationales underlying the programming language and machine learning algorithms.
