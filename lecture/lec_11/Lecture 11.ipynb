    "Of course you may argue that the \"quality\" of steps in GD is \"far better\" than SGD. Surely there is the trade-off, but pratically [the inferior performace of SGD in convergence does not obscure its super efficiency over GD](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt/lectures/stochastic-gd.pdf). In fact, SGD is the de facto optimization method in deep learning. (SGD and BP -- backward propogation to calculate the gradient are the two fundamental cornerstones in deep learning.)"
